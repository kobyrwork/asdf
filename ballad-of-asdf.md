# Ballad of asdf

> Once upon a time there was a programming language
There were many versions of it
So people wrote a version manager for it
To switch between versions for projects
Different, old, new.

> Then there came more programming languages
So there came more version managers
And many commands for them

> I installed a lot of them
I learnt a lot of commands

> Then I said, just one more version manager
Which I will write instead

> So, there came another version manager
**asdf version manager** - <https://github.com/HashNuke/asdf>

> A version manager so extendable
for which anyone can create a plugin
To support their favourite language
No more installing more version managers
Or learning more commands
